Artificial neural networks to investigate the bioavailability of selenium nanoparticles in soil-crop system

DOI: 

Abstract
Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) have potential for effective Se enrichment in crops, which is beneficial for human health. However, the interactions between Se NPs and soil-crop systems have not been extensively studied, hindering the exploration of NPs use for agricultural production. To address this gap, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is used to investigate the effects of Se NPs on soil-plant systems, particularly on rice yield and quality. The results indicate that soil application of Se NPs can enhance photosynthesis, resulting in increased yield and quality of rice (Se-enriched rice). The effects of Se NPs on rice growth and development were found to be time-dependent, with soil properties (SP) playing a primary role, followed by plant physiological activities (PPA) becoming increasingly important over time. Moreover, Se NPs pathways affecting yield and quality were distinct, with soil organic matter (TOC) being more important for rice yield and electrical conductivity (Ec) being more significant for rice quality. Therefore, this study provides a novel approach to assess the bioavailability of Se NPs in soil-crop systems and provides valuable insights into the prospects of using Se NPs to enhance rice productivity and quality. The use of model-based interpretation methods combined with experimental data allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of NPs in soil-plant system and facilitates the implementation of safe design options for NPs in agriculture.
